  # Create template-images Storage Bucket

  1. Changes

    - Document the required bucket settings
    - Provide clear instructions for manual bucket creation

  2. Security
    - Recommend appropriate RLS policies for the bucket
*/

-- This migration is a placeholder to remind you to create the storage bucket
-- Since we can't create storage buckets directly via SQL migrations,
-- you need to create the bucket manually through the Supabase dashboard

-- IMPORTANT: After applying this migration, please:
-- 1. Go to the Supabase dashboard
-- 2. Navigate to Storage
-- 3. Create a new bucket named 'template-images'
-- 4. Set the bucket to public (or configure appropriate RLS policies)
-- 5. Enable file uploads for authenticated users

-- This comment serves as documentation for the required manual step
COMMENT ON SCHEMA public IS 'Storage bucket "template-images" needs to be created manually in the Supabase dashboard';

-- Create a function to check if the bucket exists
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_template_images_bucket()
RETURNS text AS $$

  -- This function is a placeholder since we can't directly check bucket existence in SQL
  -- The actual check must be done in the application code
  RETURN 'Please create a storage bucket named "template-images" in the Supabase dashboard if it does not exist';
END;
